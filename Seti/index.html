    <p><b>The Toyota Supra</b> <i>(Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura)</i>  is <strong>a sports car and grand tourer</strong>
        <br> manufactured by Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978.
        The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".
        <br><br>
        The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. The fifth generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.<br>
