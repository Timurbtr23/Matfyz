root
value
successor

Find value:
    curr = root
    while value != curr:
        if value < curr
            curr = curr.left
        if value > curr
            curr = curr.right

When we found the value, its successor will be founded by next algorythm:
go 1 time right
and while exists ways to go left - go left. If no - return curr
