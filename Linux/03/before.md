Before class quiz (#3)
The quiz has to be submitted to your GitLab project before your lab starts.
Every question is worth 25 points.
Insert your answer inside the marked block (replace the ellipsis).

Question Q1
Briefly describe what was the most difficult or challenging part of the
previous lab for you.
Your answer: [A1] I think nothing. I worked with git. But not in the terminal. I did commits and other commands right into Pycharm [/A1]

Question Q2
Assuming file script.py has shebang of #!/usr/bin/env python3 and the user
executes the following command.

./script.py alpha.txt


Select which command from the list below best describes what is
actually executed.

python3 alpha.txt
/usr/bin/env python3 script.py alpha.txt
/usr/bin/env python3 script.py
None of the above as the command does not make any sense.
Impossible to specify as it depends on the working directory.

Your answer: [A2] 3 [/A2]

Question Q3
Assuming file script.php is written in PHP and has shebang of
#!/usr/bin/env php7 and the user executes the following command.

php3 ./script.php bravo.txt


Select all true statements from the list below (assuming interpreters
for both PHP 3 and PHP 7 are installed).

Shebang is ignored.
Script is executed with PHP 3 interpreter.
System (i.e., shell) refuses to launch the script.
Script is executed with PHP 7 interpreter.
Shell asks the user which interpreter to use (whether PHP 3 or 7).
Executable bit of the script.php is set.
Script may fail as it was intended for a newer version of PHP.

Your answer: [A3] 1 [/A3]
